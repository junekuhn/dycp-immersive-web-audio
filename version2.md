# Version 2

Instead of adding a tutorial to each, I'm going to combine the experiences to one continuous experience.  This accounts for the order of ambisonic then positional.

How I imagine it

Screens and Screens-within-experience

1. enter/info
2. put on headphones
--- no scene screen ----
3. loading / play
4. look around instruction
---- detect that listener has been looking around ----
5. Settings and exit and next scene controls
---- optional: change calibration / other settings ---
---- credits and info are also in settings ---
---- ambisonic experience ----
6. teleport and move instructions
---- positional audio experience ----
7. instrumentation / additional interactivity

Big Questions:
1. How does the instruction get relayed well for both sighted and nonsighted people?
2. Will there be any prompts for using or changing settings on the screen reader?
3. What audio will be used?
4. What other ambisonics features would be good to showcase?
5. How do I illustrate the Tab metaphor better
    a. maybe something with a path that you travel along
6.
